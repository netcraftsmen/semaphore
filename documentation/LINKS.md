*A Message Bus is commonly used in micro-service architectures to allow applications to communicate over a common, shared set of services RabbitMQ and Kafka are two popular messaging systems serving different use cases. Kafka is designed for massive data and high throughput, while RabbitMQ is for simple use cases with low traffic volumes.*

Kafka, however, has a reasonably low overhead compared to other messaging systems since it does not monitor user activity or remove messages that have been read. On the other hand, it keeps all messages for a predetermined period and leaves it up to the user to track which messages have been read.
