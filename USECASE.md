# Introduction to network telemetry using Apache Kafka in Confluent Cloud.

This session, presented by [Joel W. King](https://www.linkedin.com/in/programmablenetworks/) from [NetCraftsmen](https://netcraftsmen.com/), illustrates publishing telemetry data from the Meraki SDK to Apache Kafka deployed in Confluent Cloud. 

Kafka is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform designed for big data and high throughput. Using the developer instance of Confluent Cloud and the Python SDK, we examine the ease at which a network operator can publish and consume telemetry data to implement its own AIOps approach.
